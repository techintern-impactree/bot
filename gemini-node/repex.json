Your Company has posted record results for FY 2024. The resilient, competitive and profitable growth in the year has propelled the financial results to new highs. Let me outline some of these achievements – 1. Revenue clocked an all-time high at H 44,685 crores, up 23 % year-on-year, arising from the record sales of both vehicles and spares. 2. At H 8,825 crores, EBITDA registered its highest ever, growing a solid 35 % over previous year. 3. EBITDA margin at 19.7 % was up a significant +180 basis points over previous year driven by dynamic results management, richer product mix and operating leverage. What is also noteworthy is that your Company delivered this accretion after absorbing the significant investments on building its electric scooters business, underscoring the commitment to its growth. 4. Profit Before Tax at H 9,822 crores and Profit After Tax at H 7,479 crore, both up 33 % over last year, also hit new peaks. 5. The strong track record of cash generation was upheld as nearly H 6,600 crores of Free Cash Flow was added this year, the highest ever and up 45 % compared to last year. Apart from the records, another hallmark of the performance was the consistency of growth across all quarters. This reflects your Company’s resilient business model, where a strong domestic performance more than made up for muted exports which continued to be impacted by the challenging context in overseas markets. As a result of the landmark performance, the Balance Sheet of your Company remains very healthy with surplus cash and cash equivalent as on 31 March 2024 standing at H 16,386 crores – this after making capital investments of ~H 800 crores and paying a significant ~H 8,900 crores to shareholders between dividend and the share buyback. This financial position allows your Company to invest sufficiently for its competitive and sustainable future growth as well as reward its shareholders from time to time. Across our businesses, I am pleased to say that there is much to cheer about. Our domestic business delivered its largest revenue, on sustained momentum that led to double-digit growth for eight successive quarters. This was driven by robust volume-led growth across all businesses and market share gains. ● Your Company’s domestic motorcycle sales by volume grew by 20 % in FY 2024, compared to the previous year. It maintained its strong competitive performance and, thanks to the Pulsar, emerged as the largest 125 cc+ player of the year. ● FY 2024 was by far the biggest year for our 125 cc+ segment, where led by Pulsar models, our growth was eight times that of the rest of the industry. Your Company has been at the forefront of driving the trend of premiumization across the industry. ● KTM delivered its best ever sales. ● The introduction of Triumph has added strength to the premium portfolio, delivering over 40,000 units in the eight months post its launch, with the Speed 400 and Scrambler 400 X experience being made available across 56 cities domestically and 16 export markets by the end of the year. CHAIRMAN’S LETTER 7 Bajaj Auto Limited 17 th Annual Report 2023 - 24 NON-FINANCIALS CHAIRMAN’S LETTER 8 Bajaj Auto Limited 17 th Annual Report 2023 - 24 ● Chetak electric scooters delivered strong results, staying resolute to its journey of expansion over the last couple of years. At over 115,000 units, sales in the year were up 3 X over the previous one, enabling it climb to the #3 position in the industry, up from #7 last year ● Domestic sales of commercial vehicles surged ahead, closing the year with historic high volumes that grew significantly ahead of the industry. The year also saw the successful rollout of electric three-wheelers, with segment leadership in early launch cities leading to the acceleration of network expansion across the country. As for Exports, your Company had to navigate continued rough macro-economic conditions across its key markets. The business acted decisively to adapt and manage currency constraints and market volatility. Against this backdrop, it stepped up its sales in the second half to close the full year with flat revenue. The robust growth in Latin American markets which achieved its highest sales, further aided by the Middle East, partially alleviated the slowdown in Africa and Asia. Now coming to how I see the next year. It is anticipated that India, now the fastest growing economy in the world, will achieve upwards of 7 % real GDP growth in FY 2024, and various forecasts expect this buoyancy to continue in FY 2025. With stable CPI inflation at around 5 %, we envisage double digit nominal GDP growth. In such a milieu and barring any unforeseen event, I would expect domestic demand to continue to pave the way for another year of growth up ahead. In this context, to deliver another year of competitive and profitable performance, the priorities for our business are clear: ● Sustain the momentum on our domestic business and continue to drive growth across all segments ● Navigate the challenging international landscape and stay the course on recovering our exports volumes ● Maintain the thrust on differentiated product innovation, impactful in-market activation and superior customer experience ● Expand our capacity, capabilities and network for our new businesses, namely Chetak electric scooters, electric three wheelers and Triumph motorcycles ● Build and develop our strategic growth enablers through our wholly owned subsidiaries - — Chetak Technology Limited - as a powerhouse for disruptive and EV technology — Bajaj Auto Credit Limited – as a captive financing arm ( that commenced business in January 2024 ) which seeks complete its national presence across the sales network by the end of March 2025 ● Continue focus on dynamic financial management to ensure competitive and profitable growth with strong cash flow generation On behalf of you, our shareholders, I offer our sincerest congratulations to your Company’s Managing Director, Shri Rajiv Bajaj, and his management team and workers for delivering such a record performance in FY 2024. Given the state of the business and with such a passionate team that is capable of making a difference, I have absolute confidence that your Company is well placed to deliver yet another big year in FY 2025. I would like to thank you, our shareholders, for your support and continued trust. We appreciate it greatly. Yours sincerely, Niraj Bajaj Chairman 18 April 2024 NON-FINANCIALS CHAIRMAN’S LETTER 8 Bajaj Auto Limited 17 th Annual Report 2023 - 24 9 Bajaj Auto Limited 17 th Annual Report 2023 - 24 Among the major nations of the world, India will have posted the highest GDP growth for FY 2024. The second advance estimate released by the National Statistics Office ( NSO ) on 29 February 2024 pegged real GDP growth in FY 2024 at 7.6 %. In its latest World Economic Outlook ( January 2024 ), the IMF has placed India as the fastest growing major economy in the world for both CY 2024 and CY 2025. That is not all. Consumer price inflation ( CPI ) has significantly moderated and the current account deficit ( CAD ) has also reduced. It would seem, therefore, that the Indian economy is in a sweet spot and is by far the fastest growing major economy in the world. Given this encouraging macroeconomic scenario, it is not surprising that consumer sentiments have stepped up. And Bajaj Auto has performed better than ever before. Here is a snapshot.

This was led by the Latin America and Middle East regions which partly alleviated the drop in Africa and Asia. ● Domestic Motorcycles: Maintained its strong competitive performance. In 125 cc+ segment, led by Pulsar models, our growth was eight times that of the rest of the industry, making it the biggest ever year in this segment. ● KTM and Triumph: KTM achieved its highest sales in the year and Triumph which delivered over 40,000 units in its first eight months post launch is adding further strength to the company’s premium bike portfolio. Triumph’s expansion is well underway having been present in 56 cities domestically and 16 countries worldwide at the end of the financial year. ● Commercial Vehicles: Achieved historic high volumes, growing over 50 % year-on-year. The Bajaj ‘RE’ and ‘Maxima’ products captured an 80 % market share for the first time. The much awaited electric three wheelers was successfully rolled out and encouraging launch experience in the early cities prompted its acceleration of network expansion across the country. ● Chetak EV: Volumes tripled year-on-year, now #3 player in the segment. Product innovation, network expansion ( present in 164 cities ), and brand activation are driving this growth. Motorcycles ( domestic ) FY 2024 saw a growth of 13.9 % in the domestic motorcycle industry. In this industry, how did Bajaj Auto perform? Table 1 gives the data on domestic sales. Table 1: Domestic Sale of Motorcycles ( in numbers ) Year ended 31 March Domestic sales for the industry ( nos.) Domestic sales growth BAL’s domestic sales ( nos.) BAL’s domestic growth BAL's market share 2022 8,984,186 ( 10.3 %) 1,632,897 ( 9.7 %) 18.2 % 2023 10,230,502 13.9 % 1,769,575 8.4 % 17.3 % 2024 11,653,237 13.9 % 2,121,491 19.9 % 18.2 % In FY 2024, Bajaj Auto’s sales increased by 19.9 % to over 2.1 million units – the second highest volume of domestic sales over the last decade and consequently market share increased by 90 basis points to 18.2 %. Bajaj Auto is firmly entrenched in the domestic motorcycle market with its key brand — Pulsar. In FY 2024, Pulsar as a brand grew by 37 % and sold over 1.4 million units. This was the highest ever sales in any financial year since inception of Pulsar Having said so, a question arises: as vast number of Indian customers are getting more prosperous, style conscious and have ready access to consumer finance, are we seeing a fundamental shift in the domestic market for motorcycles? The answer is a yes. To understand it, we need to go back some 15 years when there really was an overwhelming mass of basic 100 cc motorcycles. It was a market about price, durability and fuel economy. Style, speed and power had not yet entered the consumers’ imagination. NON-FINANCIALS MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS 14 Bajaj Auto Limited 17 th Annual Report 2023 - 24 100 cc-110 cc segment: Not surprisingly, therefore, all motorcycle manufacturers focused on the 100 cc-110 cc segment; and even to this day, in terms of volumes, it accounts for 49 % of total domestic sales. In FY 2024, this segment grew by 7 %. Bajaj Auto is present here with its CT and Platina brands which averaged sales of almost 49,000 units per month and accounted for 10 % share of this category. It needs to be stated that though popular to consumers at the bottom of the riding pyramid, this segment often tend to face great pricing pressures; and have to live with small margins that come under severe pressure with rising input cost. 125 cc and above segment: Bajaj Auto has chosen to concentrate on the more stylish, more modern 125 cc and above segment — by far the fastest growing segment. Industry volume in this segment grew by an impressive 21 % in FY 2024; and it accounted for over 50 % of the total volume of motorcycle sales in India. With Pulsars, Dominars, KTMs, Husqvarnas, Avengers and Triumphs, Bajaj Auto sold over 1.5 million units in FY 2024 and accounted for 26 % share in this category. Bajaj Auto plays in both the segments. ● First, the basic 100 cc-110 cc segment. Here, the Company carefully calibrates value, balancing the price versus cost equation. ● Second, the 125 cc and above segment, which is the fastest growing and caters to customers opting for stylish, powerful and brilliantly designed ‘look-me-in-the-face’ bikes. This gives both profits and volumes. Probiking KTM and Husqvarna motorcycles form the core of Bajaj Auto’s Probiking business. In FY 2024, KTM delivered its highest ever retail sales and billing since its inception ( see Chart C ). KTM motorcycles are available across the country in 125 cc, 200 cc, 250 cc and 390 cc categories. KTM upgraded its world-famous Duke range with the third generation Duke 390 cc and the Duke 250 cc. These completely new bikes offer sharper handling, superior performance, segment first electronically driven technological features like traction control, cornering ABS and multiple ride modes. KTM also strengthened its Adventure range with the launch of the special Rally edition Adventure 390 with adjustable suspension and spoke wheels. The Husqvarna range was also upgraded with a brand-new generation of the Svartpilen 401 and the Vitpilen 401. 11,050 22,627 30,362 34,970 46,321 63,187 50,948 52,981 64,886 64,058 50,705 7,399 Annual Volume Chart C : KTM Sales in India ( nos ) Sales in India 0 10000 20000 30000 40000 50000 60000 70000 FY 2024 FY 2023 FY 2022 FY 2021 FY 2020 FY 2019 FY 2018 FY 2017 FY 2016 FY 2015 FY 2014 FY 2013 15 Bajaj Auto Limited 17 th Annual Report 2023 - 24 The business is driven on the back of world-class high-performance products, experimental rides along with community management and customer experience. The rides and community program started three years ago and goes under the Pro-XP – Experiences That Make You A Pro. The program runs tours, academies, rides and overnighters for KTM customers. This year more than 20,000 customers participated in these unique experiences. The KTM brand has been driving customer experience through high Net Promoter Score ( NPS ). Last year, it delivered an industry high 90 % NPS. Tr iump h The Triumph is a truly iconic 120 year-old British brand. Who can forget Steve McQueen, Paul Newman, Marlon Brando, Warren Beatty, Elvis Presley or Peter O’Toole riding theirs Triumphs? After years of joint development, Bajaj Auto launched two Triumph models: the Speed 400 and the Scrambler 400 X, which are being produced in our new Chakan 2 plant. As a modern classic, Triumph plays in the large bike segment and fills the gap of technology-led, high-performance motorcycles designed in their timeless forms. These two bikes were globally revealed in London in June 2023; which was followed by the first launch in India in July 2023. Both models generated unprecedented excitement and sold over 40,000 units in about nine months from launch. Bajaj Auto also took over the existing distribution network of Triumph in India of 15 showrooms. In nine months since the launch, this network has been expanded to 78 showrooms across 56 cities. Urbanite ( Chetak EV ) Chetak EV demonstrates the future of mobility – offers a digitised, fully-connected riding experience by virtue of being embedded with mobility solutions like data communication, security and user authentication. Introduced in 2020, the Company sold 8,187 units in FY 2022, 36,260 in FY 2023 and 115,702 in FY 2024. Bajaj Auto introduced a second model, the Chetak Urbane, in November 2023 and upgraded the Chetak Premium in December 2023. Currently, these two models, are offered through a network of 204 dealers in over 160 cities and is at #3 position, from #7 last year. This was achieved on the back of significant efforts behind building supply chain capabilities, investments in R&D and growing retail presence offering superior customer experience.

Total domestic sales for ICE and electric three-wheelers surpassed 681,000 units in FY 2024. Increasing CNG pump network, attractive retail finance offerings, better earnings for the drivers and pent-up demand were the key drivers of growth. The quantitative performance is highlighted in Table 3.

In FY 2024, market share increased by an impressive 490 basis points to 77.9 %. ● Bajaj Auto’s competitive position strengthened in both passenger and cargo segments. In FY 2024, sales increased by 50 % to 451,182 units. ● Bajaj Auto’s passenger vehicle sales grew by 53 % with a volume of 400,846; and that of cargo grew by 30 % to 50,336 units. A very interesting and potentially revolutionary move in FY 2024 has been Bajaj Auto introducing electric three-wheelers in both the passenger and goods carrier segments. The gaining popularity and the segment leadership in the early launch cities is very encouraging, leading to advancement of rollout plans. The electric three-wheelers are currently sold across 60 cities. We expect considerable demand in this category. 17 Bajaj Auto Limited 17 th Annual Report 2023 - 24 Exports FY 2024 has been a difficult year for exports - largely due to geopolitical uncertainties and economic challenges like hyper-inflation and scarcity in dollars availability in our key export geographies.

Bajaj Auto’s TPM at Operations In FY 2024, the Chakan plant of Bajaj Auto Ltd was conferred with the most coveted and prestigious award for ‘World Class TPM Achievement’ by JIPM ( Japan Institute of Plant Maintenance ). This is ‘The First’ for any Indian origin company’s plant across the entire industry. Chakan has become the 31 st plant in the world to get this prestigious award. Bajaj Auto also received the award for ‘Global Leaders Initiative for TPM’, which is a first for any Indian Company. Our back-end has defined various ‘focused improvement themes’. Over the years, we have established a production system that can flexibly respond to faster new product manufacturing as well as meet volatility, uncertainty, complexity and ambiguity ( VUCA ) in market demands.

Rajiv Bajaj Managing Director and CEO and Chairman of CSR Committee ( DIN: 00018262 ) Pune: 18 April 2024 73 Bajaj Auto Limited 17 th Annual Report 2023 - 24 Corporate governance is about promoting fairness, transparency, accountability, commitment to values, ethical business conduct and considering the interest of all stakeholders while conducting business. In accordance with the provisions of the Securities and Exchange Board of India ( Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements ) Regulations, 2015 and amendments thereto (‘the Listing Regulations, 2015’), given below are the corporate governance policies and practices of Bajaj Auto Ltd. (‘the Company’, ‘Bajaj Auto’ or ‘BAL’) for the year 2023 - 24 ( or ‘FY 2024’). Philosophy For us, corporate governance is a reflection of principles entrenched in our values and policies and also embedded in our day-to-day business practices, leading to value-driven growth. The commitment of the Bajaj group to the highest standards of good governance practices predates SEBI and the provisions of the Listing Regulations, 2015. Ethical dealings, transparency, fairness, disclosure and accountability are fundamental canons of the Bajaj group. Bajaj Auto Ltd. maintains the same tradition and commitment. The Governance Structure Bajaj Auto’s governance structure is based on the principles of freedom to the executive management within a given framework to ensure that the powers vested in the executive management are exercised with due care and responsibility so as to meet the expectations of all the stakeholders. In line with these principles, the Company has formed two tiers of governance structure viz.: i. The Board of Directors and its Committees:- The Board conducts overall strategic supervision and control by setting goals and reporting mechanism and decision-making process with an intent to protect the interest and value creation for all the stakeholders. The Committees of the Board are focused on specific elements of the governance like audit and internal controls, financial reporting, risk management framework, appointment and remuneration of senior management personnel, implementation and monitoring of CSR activities in furtherance to the Company’s societal commitments. ii. Executive Management:- The executive management is lead by the Managing Director and CEO who is ably assisted by the Executive Directors and the heads of Business Development, Finance, HR, R&D and other functional heads. The executive management is responsible for the day to day business, strategies, new projects and product development, financial and human resource management and policy matters. Board of Directors The Company’s policy is to have an appropriate blend of executive, independent and non-independent directors to maintain independence of the Board and to separate the Board functions of governance from that of management.

The directors are persons of eminence in areas such as business, industry, finance, economics, law, governance, etc. and bring with them experience and skills which add value to the performance of the Board and the Company while taking care of stakeholders’ interest. They take active part in the Board and Committee meetings by providing valuable guidance and expert advice to the Board and the Management on various aspects of business, governance, compliance, etc. and play critical role on strategic issues, which enhances the transparency and add value in the decision making process of the Board.

Report on the Audit of the Standalone Financial Statements Opinion We have audited the accompanying standalone financial statements of Bajaj Auto Limited ( the ‘Company’), which comprise the Balance sheet as at March 31 2024, the Statement of Profit and Loss, including the statement of Other Comprehensive Income, the Statement of Cash Flows and the Statement of Changes in Equity for the year then ended and notes to the standalone financial statements, including a summary of material accounting policies and other explanatory information. In our opinion and to the best of our information and according to the explanations given to us, the aforesaid standalone financial statements give the information required by the Companies Act, 2013, as amended ( the ‘Act’) in the manner so required and give a true and fair view in conformity with the accounting principles generally accepted in India, of the state of affairs of the Company as at 31 March 2024, its profit including other comprehensive income, its cash flows and the changes in equity for the year ended on that date. Basis for opinion We conducted our audit of the standalone financial statements in accordance with the Standards on Auditing ( SAs ), as specified under section 143 ( 10 ) of the Act. Our responsibilities under those Standards are further described in the ‘Auditors’ Responsibilities for the Audit of the Standalone Financial Statements’ section of our report. We are independent of the Company in accordance with the ‘Code of Ethics’ issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India together with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the standalone financial statements under the provisions of the Act and the Rules thereunder, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements and the Code of Ethics. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion on the standalone financial statements. Key audit matters We have determined that there are no key audit matters to communicate in our report. Other information The Company’s Board of Directors is responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the information included in the Chairman’s letter, Management Discussion and Analysis, Business Responsibility and Sustainability Report, Corporate Governance and Directors’ Report, but does not include the standalone financial statements and our auditors’ report thereon. Our opinion on the standalone financial statements does not cover the other information and we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon. In connection with our audit of the standalone financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether such other information is materially inconsistent with the standalone financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard. Responsibilities of Management for the standalone financial statements The Company’s Board of Directors is responsible for the matters stated in section 134 ( 5 ) of the Act with respect to the preparation of these standalone financial statements that give a true and fair view of the financial position, financial performance including other comprehensive income, cash flows and changes in equity of the Company in accordance with the accounting principles generally accepted in India, including the Indian Accounting Standards ( Ind AS ) specified under section 133 of the Act read with the Companies ( Indian Accounting Standards ) Rules, 2015, as amended. This responsibility also includes maintenance of adequate accounting records in accordance with the provisions of the Act for safeguarding of the assets of the Company and for preventing and detecting frauds and other irregularities; selection and application of appropriate accounting policies; making judgments and estimates that are reasonable and prudent; and the design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls, that were operating effectively for ensuring the accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, relevant to the preparation and 123 Bajaj Auto Limited 17 th Annual Report 2023 - 24 Independent Auditors‘ Report on the Standalone Financial Statements ( Contd.) presentation of the standalone financial statements that give a true and fair view and are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. In preparing the standalone financial statements, Management is responsible for assessing the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless Management either intends to liquidate the Company or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so. Those Board of Directors are also responsible for overseeing the Company’s financial reporting process. Auditors’ responsibilities for the audit of the standalone financial statements Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the standalone financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditors’ report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with SAs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these standalone financial statements. As part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also: l Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the standalone financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control. l Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances. Under section 143 ( 3 )( i ) of the Act, we are also responsible for expressing our opinion on whether the Company has adequate internal financial controls with reference to financial statements in place and the operating effectiveness of such controls. l Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management. l Conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditors’ report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditors’ report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Company to cease to continue as a going concern. l Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the standalone financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the standalone financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation. We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit. We also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.

These responsibilities include the design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls that were operating effectively for ensuring the orderly and efficient conduct of its business, including adherence to the Company’s policies, the safeguarding of its assets, the prevention and detection of frauds and errors, the accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, and the timely preparation of reliable financial information, as required under the Act. Auditors’ responsibility Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal financial controls with reference to these standalone financial statements based on our audit.

( the ‘Company’) ( CIN: L 65993 PN 2007 PLC 130076 ) is a company limited by shares, incorporated and domiciled in India. The Company is engaged in the business of development, manufacturing and distribution of automobiles such as motorcycles, commercial vehicles, electric vehicles etc. and parts thereof. The Company sells its products in India as well as in various other global markets. The registered office of the Company is located at Mumbai-Pune Road, Akurdi, Pune 411035. The standalone financial statements were approved for issue in accordance with a resolution of the Board of Directors of the Company on 18 April 2024. 1 Summary of material accounting policies followed by the Company Statement of compliance and basis of preparation These standalone financial statements have been prepared in accordance with Indian Accounting Standards ( Ind AS ) notified under section 133 of the Companies Act, 2013 (‘the Act’) read together with the Companies ( Indian Accounting Standards ) Rules, 2015, as amended from time to time and other relevant provisions of the Act, on an accrual basis. The financial statements have been prepared on a historical cost basis, except for certain financial assets and financial liabilities ( including derivative instruments ) that are measured at fair value ( refer accounting policy on financial instruments for details ). The financial statements are presented in INR, which is also the Company’s functional currency and all values are rounded to the nearest crore ( INR 0,000,000 ), except when otherwise indicated. All assets and liabilities, other than deferred tax assets and liabilities, have been classified as current or non-current as per the Company’s normal operating cycle and other criteria set out in the Schedule III ( Division II ) to the Act. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are classified as non-current assets and liabilities. Based on the nature of products and the time between the acquisition of assets for processing and their realisation in cash and cash equivalents, the Company has ascertained its operating cycle as 12 months for current and non-current classification of assets and liabilities. Material accounting policies This note provides a list of the material accounting policies adopted in the preparation of these financial statements. These policies have been consistently applied to all the years presented, unless otherwise stated. 1 Use of estimates, judgments and assumptions The preparation of the Company’s financial statements requires the management to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities, and the accompanying disclosures, and the disclosure of contingent liabilities. Actual results may differ from these estimates. Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimates are revised and in any future periods affected. In particular, information about significant areas of estimation uncertainty and critical judgments in applying accounting policies that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements is included in the following notes and in the relevant notes together with information about basis of calculation for each affected line item in the financial statements: a ) Valuation of investments [ Refer note 1.6 and note 32 ] b ) Derivative instruments [ Refer note 1.7 ] c ) Revenue and trade receivables [ Refer note 1.2, note 10 and note 23 ] d ) Provisions and Contingent liabilities [ Refer note 1.13, note 16 and note 35 ] e ) Residual value and useful life of property, plant and equipment, intangible assets [ Refer note 1.3 ] 2 Revenue from contracts with customers Revenue is recognised when control of goods ( vehicles or parts ) and services have been transferred to the customer; at an amount that reflects the consideration which the Company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. Amounts disclosed as revenue are net of goods and service tax ( GST ). STANDALONE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTES 142 Bajaj Auto Limited 17 th Annual Report 2023 - 24 Notes to standalone financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2024 ( Contd.) 1 Summary of material accounting policies followed by the Company ( Contd.) Sale of Goods ( vehicles or parts ) The Company has determined that our customers from the sale of goods are generally dealers and distributors. Transfer of control, and therefore revenue recognition, generally corresponds to the date when the goods are released to the carrier responsible for transporting them to the customer in the following manner: l Domestic sales are recognised at the time of dispatch from the point of sale; l Export sales are recognised on the date when shipped on board as per terms of sale and are initially recorded at the relevant exchange rates prevailing on the date of the transaction Revenue towards satisfaction of a performance obligation is measured at the amount of transaction price ( net of variable consideration and consideration payable to customers ) allocated to that performance obligation. In determining the transaction price for the sale of goods, the Company considers the effects of variable consideration, consideration payable to the customer and the existence of significant financing components ( if any ). Variable consideration If the consideration in a contract includes a variable amount ( like volume rebates/incentives, cash discounts, subventions etc.), the Company estimates the amount of consideration to which it will be entitled in exchange for transferring the goods to the customer. The variable consideration is estimated at contract inception and constrained until it is highly probable that a significant revenue reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognised will not occur when the associated uncertainty with the variable consideration is subsequently resolved. The estimate of variable consideration for expected future volume rebates/ incentives, cash discounts, subventions etc. are made on the most likely amount method. Consideration payable to the customer Consideration payable to a customer includes cash amounts that the Company pays, or expects to pay, to the customer. Financing component Generally, the Company receives short-term advances from its customers. The Company applies the practical expedient for short-term advances received from customers. That is, the promised amount of consideration is not adjusted for the effects of a significant financing component if the period between the transfer of the promised good or service and the payment is one year or less. In cases where the Company does not receive short-term advances from its customers, the terms of contract with customers do not contain any express or implied payment terms which would indicate the existence of a significant financing component. Principal versus agent consideration in respect of freight The Company, on behalf of its customers ( dealers and distributors ), dispatches goods to agreed locations for an agreed fee. The Company has determined that the performance obligation of the Company is to arrange for those goods and services ( Company is an agent ) to the customers and hence the amount charged to the customer offset by freight charges paid to the freight service providers is shown as revenue and disclosed as other operating income or other operating expenses, depending upon the results of the offsetting. Contract balances Trade receivables A receivable represents the Company’s right to an amount of consideration that is unconditional ( i.e., only the passage of time is required before payment of the consideration is due ). Contract liabilities Advance received from customers A contract liability is the obligation to transfer goods to a customer for which the Company has received consideration ( or an amount of consideration is due ) from the customer. If a customer pays consideration before the Company transfers goods or services to the customer, a contract liability is recognised when the payment is received, or the payment is due ( whichever is earlier ). Contract liabilities are recognised as revenue when the Company performs under the contract. 143 Bajaj Auto Limited 17 th Annual Report 2023 - 24 Other operating revenue Interest charged to dealers for payment beyond due date and Royalty income is recognised on accrual basis in accordance with the substance of their relevant agreements. In respect of Government Grants recognised as Other operating revenue, refer to accounting policy no. 15 ‘Government Grants’ 3 Property, plant and equipment and depreciation/amortisation A. Property, plant and equipment i ) Capital work in progress is stated at cost, net of accumulated impairment loss, if any. Property, plant and equipment except land are carried at historical cost of acquisition, construction or manufacturing, as the case may be, less accumulated depreciation and amortisation. Freehold land is carried at cost of acquisition. ii ) Cost represents all expenses directly attributable to bringing the asset to its working condition capable of operating in the manner intended. Such cost includes the cost of replacing part of the plant and equipment, if the recognition criteria are met. When significant parts of plant and equipment are required to be replaced at intervals, the Company depreciates them separately based on their specific useful lives. Likewise, when a major inspection is performed, its cost is recognised in the carrying amount of the plant and equipment as a replacement if the recognition criteria are satisfied. All other repair and maintenance costs are recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss as incurred. iii ) Costs incurred to manufacture/construct property, plant and equipment are reduced from the total expense under the head ‘Expenses, included in above items, capitalised’ in the Statement of Profit and Loss. iv ) Land and buildings acquired/constructed, not intended to be used in the operations of the Company and held for earning long-term rental yields or for capital appreciation or both, and that is not occupied by the Company, are categorised as investment property. v ) An item of property, plant and equipment and any significant part initially recognised is derecognised upon disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected from its use or disposal. Any gain or loss arising on derecognition of the asset ( calculated as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset ) is included in the Statement of Profit and Loss when the asset is derecognised. vi ) The residual values, useful lives and methods of depreciation of property, plant and equipment are reviewed at each financial year end and adjusted prospectively, if appropriate. B. Depreciation and amortisation methods, estimated useful lives and residual value ( a ) Leasehold land Premium on leasehold land is amortised over the period of lease. ( b ) Other tangible assets i. a. Depreciation is provided on a pro-rata basis on straight-line method to allocate the cost, net of residual value over the estimated useful lives of the assets. The estimated useful lives are as follows: Asset classUseful life Buildings 03 - 60 years Water pumps, reservoirs and mains 05 - 15 years Plant and machinery 10 - 15 years Computers and IT Equipment 03 - 06 years Dies and Moulds 03 - 08 years Electric installations 10 years Notes to standalone financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2024 ( Contd.) 1 Summary of material accounting policies followed by the Company ( Contd.) STANDALONE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTES 144 Bajaj Auto Limited 17 th Annual Report 2023 - 24 Asset classUseful life Factory equipment’s 08 - 15 years Furniture 10 years Office equipment 05 - 13 years Electric fittings 10 Years Vehicles 03 - 10 Years b. Where a significant component ( in terms of cost ) of an asset has an estimated economic useful life shorter than that of its corresponding asset, the component is depreciated over its shorter life. c. The Company, based on technical assessment made by technical expert and Management estimate, depreciates certain items of property, plant and equipment over estimated useful lives which are different from the useful life prescribed in Schedule II to the Companies Act, 2013. The Management believes that these estimated useful lives are realistic and reflect fair approximation of the period over which the assets are likely to be used. ii. Assets which are depreciated over useful life/residual value different than those indicated by Schedule II are as under: Asset classAs per Schedule IIUseful life Aircraft 20 years 10 years PDC Dies 8 years 3 years Factory equipment 15 years 10 years iii. Depreciation on additions is being provided on pro rata basis from the date of such month of such additions. iv. Depreciation on assets sold, discarded or demolished during the year is being provided up to the month in which such assets are sold, discarded or demolished. 4 Intangible assets Intangible assets with finite lives are amortised over the useful economic life and assessed for impairment whenever there is an indication that the intangible asset may be impaired. The amortisation period and the amortisation method for an intangible asset with a finite useful life are reviewed at least at the end of each reporting period. Changes in the expected useful life or the expected pattern of consumption of future economic benefits embodied in the asset are considered to modify the amortisation period or method, as appropriate, and are treated as changes in accounting estimates. The amortisation expense on intangible assets with finite lives is recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss unless such expenditure forms part of carrying value of another asset. A. Technical know-how acquired Technical know-how acquired is stated at acquisition cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses, if any. Acquired technical know-how is amortised equally over a period of estimated useful life. An intangible asset is derecognised upon disposal ( i.e., at the date the recipient obtains control ) or when no future economic benefits are expected from its use or disposal. Any gain or loss arising upon derecognition of the asset ( calculated as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset ) is included in the Statement of Profit and Loss when the asset is derecognised. B. Technical know-how developed by the Company i ) Expenditure incurred by the Company on development of know-how researched, is recognised as an intangible asset, if and only if the future economic benefits attributable to the use of such know-how are probable to flow to the Company and the costs/expenditure can be measured reliably. ii ) Costs incurred to develop an intangible asset are reduced from total expenses and disclosed under the head ‘Expenses, included in above items, capitalised’ in the Statement of Profit and Loss. iii ) The cost of technical know-how developed is amortised equally over its estimated useful life i.e. generally three years from the date of commencement of commercial production.

C. Research and development costs Expenditure on research and development activities is recognised as an expense in the period in which it is incurred unless the recognition criteria are met. Research costs are expensed as incurred. Development expenditures on an individual project are recognised as an intangible asset when the Company can demonstrate: l The technical feasibility of completing the intangible asset so that the asset will be available for use or sale l Its intention to complete and its ability and intention to use or sell the asset l How the asset will generate future economic benefits l The availability of resources to complete the asset l The ability to measure reliably the expenditure during development Following initial recognition of the development expenditure as an asset, the asset is carried at cost less any accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses. Amortisation of the asset begins when development is complete, and the asset is available for use. It is amortised over the period of expected future benefit. Amortisation expense is recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss unless such expenditure forms part of carrying value of another asset. During the period of development, the asset is tested for impairment annually. 5 Investment property Property which is held for long-term rental yields or for capital appreciation or both, and that is not occupied by the Company, is classified as investment property. Investment property is measured initially at its cost, including related transaction costs. Subsequent expenditure is capitalised to the asset’s carrying amount only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the expenditure will flow to the Company and the cost of the item can be measured reliably. Repairs and maintenance costs are expensed when incurred. Depreciation on investment property is provided on a pro rata basis on straight line method over the estimated useful lives. Useful life of assets, as assessed by the Management, corresponds to those prescribed by Schedule II- Part ‘C’ of the Companies Act, 2013. Investment properties are derecognised either when they have been disposed of or when they are permanently withdrawn from use and no future economic benefit is expected from their disposal. The difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset is recognised in Statement of Profit and Loss in the period of derecognition. 6 Investments, financial assets and financial liabilities A. Investment in subsidiaries and associate Interest in subsidiaries and associate are recognised at cost less impairment ( if any ). Cost represents amount paid for acquisition of the said investments. The Company assesses at the end of each reporting period, if there are any indications that the said investments may be impaired. If so, the Company estimates the recoverable value/amount of the investment and provides for impairment, if any i.e. the deficit in the recoverable value over cost. B. Other investments and financial assets i. Classification The company classifies its financial assets at initial recognition in the following measurement categories: l those to be measured subsequently at fair value ( either through other comprehensive income, or through profit or loss ), and l those to be measured at amortised cost. The classification is done depending upon the Company’s business model for managing the financial assets and the contractual terms of the cash flows. STANDALONE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTES 146 Bajaj Auto Limited 17 th Annual Report 2023 - 24 Notes to standalone financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2024 ( Contd.) 1 Summary of material accounting policies followed by the Company ( Contd.) For assets classified as ‘measured at fair value’, gains and losses will either be recorded in profit or loss or other comprehensive income, as elected. For assets classified as ‘measured at amortised cost’, this will depend on the business model and contractual terms of the cash flows. ii. Measurement Initial Measurement Financial assets are classified, at initial recognition, as subsequently measured at amortised cost, fair value through other comprehensive income ( FVTOCI ), or fair value through profit or loss ( FVTPL ). The classification of financial assets at initial recognition depends on the financial asset’s contractual cash flow characteristics and the Company’s business model for managing them. At initial recognition, the Company measures a financial asset at its fair value including, in the case of ‘a financial asset not at FVTPL’, transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition of the financial asset. Transaction costs of financial assets carried at ‘FVTPL’ are expensed in the Statement of Profit and Loss, when incurred. Trade receivables that do not contain a significant financing component or for which the Company has applied the practical expedient are measured at the transaction price determined under Ind AS 115. Refer accounting policy no.2 ‘Revenue from contracts with customers’. For a financial asset to be classified and subsequently measured at amortised cost or FVTOCI ( excluding equity instruments which are measured at FVTOCI ), it needs to give rise to cash flows that are ‘solely payments of principal and interest ( SPPI )’ on the principal amount outstanding. This assessment is referred to as the SPPI test and is performed at an instrument level. Financial assets with cash flows that are not SPPI are classified and measured at FVTPL, irrespective of the business model. The Company’s business model for managing financial assets refers to how it manages its financial assets to generate cash flows. The business model determines whether cash flows will result from collecting contractual cash flows, selling the financial assets, or both. Subsequent Measurement Subsequent measurement of financial assets depends on the Company’s business model for managing the financial asset and the cash flow characteristics of the financial asset. There are three measurement categories into which the Company classifies its financial instruments: Subsequently measured at amortised cost: A ‘debt instrument’ is measured at the amortised cost if both the following conditions are met: a ) The asset is held within a business model whose objective is to hold assets for collecting contractual cash flows, and b ) Contractual terms of the asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest ( SPPI ) on the principal amount outstanding. Financial assets that are held for collection of contractual cash flows where those cash flows represent SPPI are measured at amortised cost e.g. debentures, bonds, fixed maturity plans, trade receivables etc. This category is the most relevant to the Company. After initial measurement, such financial assets are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate ( EIR ) method. Amortised cost is calculated by taking into account any discount or premium on acquisition and fees or costs that are an integral part of the EIR. Interest income from trade receivables is included in other operating income in the Statement of Profit and Loss; whilst interest income from the remaining financial assets is included in other income in the Statement of Profit and Loss. The losses arising from impairment are recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss. A gain or loss on a financial asset that is subsequently measured at amortised cost is recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss when the asset is derecognised or impaired. In case of fixed maturity plans ( FMP ), they are measured at amortised cost, if the Company intends to hold the FMPs to maturity. Further, the Company applies amortised cost for those FMPs where the Company is able to demonstrate that the underlying instruments in the portfolio would fulfill the SPPI test and the churn in the underlying portfolio is negligible. These conditions are assessed at each balance sheet date. If these conditions are not fulfilled, then FMPs are valued at FVTPL. 147 Bajaj Auto Limited 17 th Annual Report 2023 - 24 The Company intends to hold its investment in open ended target maturity funds ( i.e. exchange traded funds/ETF ) till maturity. It may be noted that these funds have a pre-determined maturity date. These funds follow a passive buy and hold strategy; in which the existing underlying investment bonds are expected to be held till maturity unless sold for meeting redemptions or rebalancing requirements as stated in the scheme document. In our view, such strategy mitigates intermittent price volatility in open ended target maturity funds’ underlying investments; and investors who remain invested until maturity are expected to mitigate the market/volatility risk to a large extent. These funds can invest only in plain vanilla INR bonds with fixed coupon and maturity; and cannot invest in floating rate bonds. Based on this, the Company believes that the investments in open ended target maturity funds meet the requirements of SPPI test as per the requirements of Ind AS 109. Subsequently measured at FVTOCI: All equity investments in scope of Ind AS 109 are measured at fair value. Equity instruments which are held for trading, if any, are classified as at FVTPL. For all other equity instruments, the Company may make an irrevocable election to present in other comprehensive income subsequent changes in the fair value. The Company makes such election on an instrument-by- instrument basis. The classification is made on initial recognition and is irrevocable. Equity instruments included within the FVTOCI category are measured initially as well as at each reporting date at fair value. Fair value movements are recognised in the other comprehensive income ( OCI ). If the Company decides to classify an equity instrument as at FVTOCI, then all fair value changes on the instrument, excluding dividends, are recognised in OCI. There is no recycling of the amounts from OCI to Statement of Profit and Loss, even on sale of investment. However, the Company may transfer the cumulative gain or loss within equity. Subsequently measured at FVTPL: Financial assets that do not meet the criteria for amortised cost and FVTOCI are measured at fair value through profit or loss e.g. investments in mutual funds. A gain or loss on a financial asset that is subsequently measured at fair value through profit or loss is recognised in profit or loss and presented net in the Statement of Profit and Loss within other gains/( losses ) in the period in which it arises. Debt instruments included within the FVTPL category are measured at fair value with all changes recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss. iii. Impairment of financial assets The Company assesses on a forward-looking basis, the expected credit losses associated with its financial assets carried at amortised cost for e.g., debt securities, deposits, trade receivables and bank balances. The impairment methodology applied depends on whether there has been a significant increase in credit risk and if so, assess the need to provide for the same in the Statement of Profit and Loss. The Company follows ‘simplified approach’ for recognition of impairment loss allowance on trade receivables. The application of simplified approach does not require the Company to track changes in credit risk. Rather, it recognises impairment loss allowance based on lifetime expected credit losses ( ECL ) at each reporting date, right from its initial recognition. In respect of other financial assets ( eg.: debt securities, deposits, bank balances etc ), the Company generally invests in instruments with high credit rating and consequently low credit risk. In the unlikely event that the credit risk increases significantly from inception of investment, lifetime ECL is used for recognising impairment loss on such assets. Lifetime ECL are the expected credit losses resulting from all possible default events over the expected life of a financial instrument. ECL is the difference between all contractual cash flows that are due to the Company in accordance with the contract and all the cash flows that the entity expects to receive ( i.e., all cash shortfalls ), discounted at the original EIR. When estimating the cash flows, an entity is required to consider all contractual terms of the financial instrument over the expected life of the financial instrument. ECL impairment loss allowance ( or reversal ) recognised during the period is recognised as income/expense in the Statement of Profit and Loss. This amount is reflected under the head ‘other expenses’ in the Statement of Profit and Loss. The Balance Sheet presentation for various financial instruments is described below: Notes to standalone financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2024 ( Contd.) 1 Summary of material accounting policies followed by the Company ( Contd.) STANDALONE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTES 148 Bajaj Auto Limited 17 th Annual Report 2023 - 24 l Financial assets measured at amortised cost and trade receivables: ECL is presented as an allowance, i.e., as an integral part of the measurement of those assets in the Balance Sheet. The allowance reduces the net carrying amount. Until the asset meets write-off criteria, the Company does not reduce impairment allowance from the gross carrying amount. For assessing increase in credit risk and impairment loss, the Company combines financial instruments based on shared credit risk characteristics with the objective of facilitating an analysis that is designed to enable significant increases in credit risk to be identified on a timely basis. For debt instruments at fair value through OCI, the Company applies the low credit risk simplification. At every reporting date, the Company evaluates whether the debt instrument is considered to have low credit risk using all reasonable and supportable information that is available without undue cost or effort. In making that evaluation, the Company reassesses the internal credit rating of the debt instrument. However, in certain cases, the Company may also consider a financial asset to be in default when internal or external information indicates that the Company is unlikely to receive the outstanding contractual amounts in full before taking into account any credit enhancements held by the Company. A financial asset is written off when there is no reasonable expectation of recovering the contractual cash flows. iv. Derecognition of financial assets A financial asset is derecognised only when Company has transferred the rights to receive cash flows from the financial asset or the rights to receive cash flows from the financial asset have expired. Where the entity has transferred an asset, the Company evaluates whether it has transferred substantially all risks and rewards of ownership of the financial asset. In such cases, the financial asset is derecognised. v. Reclassification of financial assets The Company determines classification of financial assets and liabilities on initial recognition. After initial recognition, no reclassification is made for financial assets which are equity instruments and financial liabilities. For financial assets which are debt instruments, a reclassification is made only if there is a change in the business model for managing those assets. Changes to the business model are expected to be infrequent. The Company’s senior management determines change in the business model as a result of external or internal changes which are significant to the Company’s operations. Such changes are evident to external parties. A change in the business model occurs when the Company either begins or ceases to perform an activity that is significant to its operations. If the Company reclassifies financial assets, it applies the reclassification prospectively from the reclassification date which is the first day of the immediately next reporting period following the change in business model. The Company does not restate any previously recognised gains, losses ( including impairment gains or losses ) or interest. The Company applies amortised cost, where it has ability to demonstrate that the underlying instruments in the portfolio fulfill the solely payments of principal and interest (‘SPPI’) test and the churn in the portfolio is negligible. C. Financial liabilities Financial liabilities are classified, at initial recognition, as financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss, loans and borrowings, payables, as appropriate. All financial liabilities are recognised initially at fair value and, in the case of borrowings in nature of bank overdrafts/credit facilities and payables, net of directly attributable transaction costs. The Company’s financial liabilities includes trade and other payables, borrowings in nature of bank overdrafts/credit facilities. For purposes of subsequent measurement, financial liabilities are classified at amortised cost. 7 Derivative and hedging activities The Company uses derivative financial instruments such as range forward and par forward currency contracts to hedge its foreign currency risks. Such derivative instruments are initially recognised at fair value on the date at which the derivative contract is entered and are subsequently re-measured at fair value as at the end of each reporting period. The accounting for subsequent changes in fair value depends on whether the derivative is designated as a hedging instrument, and if so, the nature of the item being hedged, and the type of hedge relationship designated. The Company documents its risk management objectives and strategy for undertaking various hedge transactions. In terms thereof, the Company designates their derivatives as hedges of foreign exchange risks associated with the cash flow of highly probable forecast transactions ( viz. export sales ). Notes to standalone financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2024 ( Contd.) 1 Summary of material accounting policies followed by the Company ( Contd.) 149 Bajaj Auto Limited 17 th Annual Report 2023 - 24 The full fair value of a hedging derivative is classified as a non-current asset or liability when the remaining maturity of the hedged item is more than 12 months; it is classified as a current asset or liability when the remaining maturity of the hedged item is less than or equal to 12 months. Cash flow hedges that qualify for hedge accounting – The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges is recognised in the other comprehensive income in cash flow hedging reserve within equity, limited to the cumulative change in fair value of the hedged item on a present value basis from the inception of the hedge. The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the Statement of Profit and Loss, within other gains/( losses ). For hedge accounting, hedges are classified as Cash flow hedges when hedging the exposure to variability in cash flows that is either attributable to a risk associated with a recognised asset or liability or a highly probable forecast transaction or the foreign currency risk in an unrecognised firm commitment. When forward contracts are used to hedge forecast transactions, the Company designates them in entirety as the hedging instrument. Any gains or losses arising from changes in the fair value for the effective portion of cash flow hedges is recognised in OCI and later reclassified to profit or loss when the hedge item affects profit or loss. Where option contracts are used to hedge forecast transactions, the Company designates intrinsic value of the option contract as hedging instrument. Gains or losses relating to the effective portion of the change in intrinsic value of the option contract are recognised in the ‘Cash flow hedging reserve’ within equity. The changes in time value of the option contracts that relate to the hedged items are recognised through other comprehensive income in ‘Costs of hedging reserve’ within equity. When a hedging instrument expires, or is sold, or when a hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, any cumulative gain or loss existing in equity at that time is recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss. When a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss that was reported in equity is immediately transferred to the Statement of Profit and Loss. When a hedging instrument is unexercised and expires, the cumulative gain or loss is reversed within equity with the corresponding effect to the hedge receivable/payable. If the hedge ratio for risk management is no longer optimal, but risk management objectives remain unchanged and hedge continues to qualify for hedge accounting, the hedge relationships are re-balanced so that the hedge ratio aligns. Consequently, hedge ineffectiveness is computed and accounted for in the Statement of Profit and Loss immediately. 8 Impairment of non-financial assets Assets are tested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the asset’s carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s fair value less cost of disposal and value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset. For the purposes of assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are separately identifiable cash inflows which are largely independent of the cash inflows from other assets or group of assets ( cash-generating units ). Impairment loss of non-financial assets, if any are recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss. 9 Foreign currency transactions i ) Items included in the financial statements are measured using the currency of the primary economic environment in which the Company operates (‘the functional currency’). ii ) On initial recognition, all foreign currency transactions are recorded at the foreign exchange rate on the date of the transaction. iii ) Monetary assets and liabilities in foreign currency outstanding at the close of the financial year are revalorised at the appropriate exchange rates prevailing at the close of the year. iv ) The gain or loss on decrease/increase in reporting currency due to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, in case of monetary assets and liabilities in foreign currency, are recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss. Notes to standalone financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2024 ( Contd.) 1 Summary of material accounting policies followed by the Company ( Contd.) STANDALONE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTES 150 Bajaj Auto Limited 17 th Annual Report 2023 - 24 v ) Fixed assets purchased at liaison offices in foreign exchange are recorded at their historical cost computed with reference to the average rate of foreign exchange remitted to the liaison office. vi ) Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rates at the dates of the initial transactions. vii ) In determining the spot exchange rate to use on initial recognition of the related asset, expense or income ( or part of it ) on the derecognition of a non-monetary asset or non-monetary liability relating to advance consideration, the date of the transaction is the date on which the Company initially recognises the non-monetary asset or non-monetary liability arising from the advance consideration. If there are multiple payments or receipts in advance, the Company determines the transaction date for each payment or receipt of advance consideration. 10 Inventories Cost of inventories have been computed to include all costs of purchases ( including materials ), cost of conversion and other costs incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and condition. i ) Finished stocks of vehicles and auto spare parts and stocks of work-in-progress are valued at cost of manufacturing or net realisable value whichever is lower. Cost is calculated on a weighted average basis. ii ) Stores, packing materials and tools which does not meet the recognition criteria of property, plant and equipment are valued at cost arrived at on a weighted average basis or net realisable value, whichever is lower. iii ) Raw materials and components are valued at cost arrived at on a weighted average basis or net realisable value, whichever is lower. iv ) Inventory of machinery spares and maintenance materials not being material are expensed in the year of purchase. v ) Goods in transit are stated at actual cost incurred up to the date of Balance Sheet. Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less estimated costs of completion and the estimated costs necessary to make the sale. 11 Employee benefits a ) Privilege leave entitlements Privilege leave entitlements are recognised as a liability, in the calendar year of rendering of service, as per the rules of the Company. As accumulated leave can be availed and/or encashed at any time during the tenure of employment, subject to terms and conditions of the scheme, the accumulated leave, which is expected to be utilised within the next 12 months, is treated as short-term employee benefit. The Company measures the expected cost of such absences as the additional amount that it expects to pay as a result of the unused entitlement that has accumulated at the reporting date. They are therefore measured at the present value of expected future payments to be made in respect of services provided by employees up to the end of the reporting period using the projected unit credit method. The benefits are discounted using the market yields at the end of the reporting period that have terms approximating to the terms of the related obligation. Remeasurements as a result of experience adjustments and changes in actuarial assumptions are recognised in Statement of Profit and Loss. b ) Gratuity Payment for present liability of future payment of gratuity is being made to approved gratuity fund, which fully covers the same under Cash Accumulation Policy and Debt fund of the Life Insurance Corporation of India ( LIC ) and Bajaj Allianz Life Insurance Company Ltd. ( BALIC ). However, any deficit in plan assets managed by LIC and BALIC as compared to the liability based on an independent actuarial valuation is recognised as a liability. The liability or asset recognised in the Balance Sheet in respect of defined benefit gratuity plans is the present value of the defined benefit obligation at the end of the reporting period less the fair value of plan assets. The defined benefit obligation is calculated annually by actuaries using the projected unit credit method in conformity with the principles and manner of computation specified in Ind AS 19. Notes to standalone financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2024 ( Contd.) 1 Summary of material accounting policies followed by the Company ( Contd.) 151 Bajaj Auto Limited 17 th Annual Report 2023 - 24 Remeasurements, comprising of actuarial gains and losses, the effect of the asset ceiling, excluding amounts included in net interest on the net defined benefit liability and the return on plan assets ( excluding amounts included in net interest on the net defined benefit liability ), are recognised immediately in the Balance Sheet with a corresponding debit or credit to retained earnings through OCI in the period in which they occur. Remeasurements are not reclassified to profit or loss in subsequent periods. The net interest cost is calculated by applying the discount rate to the net balance of the defined benefit obligation and the fair value of plan assets. This cost is included in employee benefit expense in the Statement of Profit and Loss. c ) Provident fund contributions are made to Company’s Provident Fund Trust. The contributions are accounted for as defined benefit plans and the contributions are recognised as employee benefit expense when an employee renders the related service. Deficits, if any, of the fund as compared to liability based on an independent actuarial valuation is to be additionally contributed by the Company and hence recognised as a liability. 12 Taxation a ) Current income tax assets and liabilities are measured at the amount expected to be recovered from or paid to the taxation authorities, in accordance with the Income Tax Act, 1961; and the Income Computation and Disclosure Standards prescribed therein. The tax rates and tax laws used to compute the amount are those that are enacted or substantively enacted, at the reporting date. b ) Current income tax relating to items recognised outside profit or loss is recognised outside profit or loss ( either in other comprehensive income or in equity ). Current tax items are recognised in correlation to the underlying transaction either in OCI or directly in equity. Management periodically evaluates positions taken in the tax returns with respect to situations in which applicable tax regulations are subject to interpretation and establishes provisions where appropriate. c ) Deferred tax is provided using the liability method on temporary differences arising between the tax base of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the financial statements. Deferred tax is determined using tax rates that have been enacted or substantially enacted by the end of the reporting period and are expected to apply when the related deferred tax asset is realised or the deferred tax liability is settled. Deferred tax assets are recognised for all deductible temporary differences and unused tax losses only if it is probable that future taxable amounts will be available to utilise those temporary differences. The Company offsets deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities if and only if it has a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets and current tax liabilities and the deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority which intend either to settle current tax liabilities and assets on a net basis, or to realise the assets and settle the liabilities simultaneously, in each future period in which significant amounts of deferred tax liabilities or assets are expected to be settled or recovered. 13 Provisions and contingent liabilities The Company creates a provision when there is present obligation as a result of past events and it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation. A disclosure for a contingent liability is made when there is a possible obligation or a present obligation that may, but probably will not, require an outflow of resources. When the likelihood of outflow of resources is remote, no provision or disclosure is made. 14 Leases including investment properties The Company assesses at contract inception whether a contract is, or contains, a lease. That is, if the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration. As a lessee a ) Short-term leases and leases of low value assets The Company applies the short-term lease recognition exemption to its short-term leases of office spaces and certain equipment ( i.e., those leases that have a lease term of 12 months or less from the commencement date and do not contain a purchase option ). It also applies the lease of low-value assets recognition exemption to leases of office equipment that are considered to be low value. Lease payments on short-term leases and leases of low-value assets are recognised as expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Notes to standalone financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2024 ( Contd.) 1 Summary of material accounting policies followed by the Company ( Contd.) STANDALONE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTES 152 Bajaj Auto Limited 17 th Annual Report 2023 - 24 As a lessor Leases in which the Company does not transfer substantially all the risks and rewards incidental to ownership of an asset are classified as operating leases. Rental income arising is accounted for on a straight-line basis over the lease terms. Initial direct costs incurred in negotiating and arranging an operating lease are added to the carrying amount of the leased asset and recognised over the lease term on the same basis as rental income 15 Government grant and Incentives Grants from the Government are recognised at their fair value where there is a reasonable assurance that the grant will be received, and the Company will comply with all attached conditions. Government grants relating to income are deferred and recognised in the profit or loss over the period necessary to match them with the costs that they are intended to compensate and presented within other operating revenue. Government grants in the nature of export incentives are accounted for in the period of export of goods if the entitlements can be estimated with reasonable accuracy and conditions precedent to claim are reasonably expected to be fulfilled. When loans or similar assistance are provided by Governments or related institutions, with an interest rate below the current applicable market rate, the effect of this favorable interest is regarded as a Government grant. The loan or assistance is initially recognised and measured at fair value and the Government grant is measured as the difference between the initial carrying value of the loan and the proceeds received. The loan is subsequently measured as per the accounting policy applicable to financial liabilities. 16 Dividends Provision is made for any dividend declared, being appropriately authorised and no longer at the discretion of the entity, on or before the end of the reporting period but not distributed at the end of the reporting period. 17 Cash and cash equivalents For presentation in the Statement of Cash Flows, cash and cash equivalents includes cash on hand, other short-term, highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and which are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value. 18 Earnings per share Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the net profit or loss for the period attributable to equity shareholders by the weighted average number of equity shares outstanding during the period. Earnings considered in ascertaining the Company’s earnings per share is the net profit for the period. The weighted average number of equity shares outstanding during the period and all periods presented is adjusted for events, such as bonus shares, other than the conversion of potential equity shares that have changed the number of equity shares outstanding without a corresponding change in resources. For calculating diluted earnings per share, the net profit or loss for the period attributable to equity shareholders and the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the period is adjusted for the effects of all dilutive potential equity shares. 19 Segment reporting Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the Core Management Committee which includes the Managing Director who is the Chief Operating Decision Maker. The Core Management Committee examines performance both from a product as well as from a geographical perspective and has identified three operative reportable segments from which significant risks and rewards are derived viz. Automotive business and Investments and Others. 20 Fair value measurement The Company measures financial instruments, such as, derivatives at fair value at each Balance Sheet date. Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Notes to standalone financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2024 ( Contd.) 1 Summary of material accounting policies followed by the Company ( Contd.) 153 Bajaj Auto Limited 17 th Annual Report 2023 - 24 The fair value measurement is based on the presumption that the transaction to sell the asset or transfer the liability takes place either: l In the principal market for the asset or liability, or l In the absence of a principal market, in the most advantageous market for the asset or liability. The principal or the most advantageous market must be accessible by the Company. The fair value of an asset or a liability is measured using the assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability, assuming that market participants act in their best economic interest. A fair value measurement of a non-financial asset takes into account a market participant’s ability to generate economic benefits by using the asset in its highest and best use or by selling it to another market participant that would use the asset in its highest and best use. The Company uses valuation techniques that are appropriate in the circumstances and for which sufficient data are available to measure fair value, maximising the use of relevant observable inputs and minimising the use of unobservable inputs. All assets and liabilities for which fair value is measured or disclosed in the financial statements are categorised within the fair value hierarchy, described as follows, based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement as a whole: l Level 1 – Quoted ( unadjusted ) market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities l Level 2 – Valuation techniques for which the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement is directly or indirectly observable l Level 3 – Valuation techniques for which the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement is unobservable. The Company has set policies and procedures for both recurring and non-recurring fair value measurement of financial assets, which includes valuation techniques and inputs to use for each case. For fair value disclosures, the Company has determined classes of assets and liabilities based on the nature, characteristics and risks of the asset or liability and the level of the fair value hierarchy as explained above. This note summarises accounting policy for fair value. Other fair value related disclosures are given in the relevant notes. l Disclosures for valuation methods, significant estimates and assumptions ( note 1.1 ) l Quantitative disclosures of fair value measurement hierarchy ( note 32 ) l Investment properties ( note 3 ) l Financial instruments ( including those carried at amortised cost ) ( note 32 ) 21 Other Income a ) Dividends Dividends are recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss only when the right to receive payment is established, and it is probable that the economic benefits associated with the dividend will flow to the Company and that the amount of the dividend can be measured reliably. b ) Other income The Company recognises income on accrual basis. However, where the ultimate collection of the same lacks reasonable certainty, revenue recognition is postponed to the extent revenue is reasonably certain and can be reliably measured. Notes to standalone financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2024 ( Contd.) 1 Summary of material accounting policies followed by the Company ( Contd.) STANDALONE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTES 154 Bajaj Auto Limited 17 th Annual Report 2023 - 24 22 Share based payment arrangements Certain employees ( including senior executives ) of the Company receive part of their remuneration in the form of employee stock options ( ESOP ). The cost of equity-settled transactions is determined by the fair value at the date when the grant is made using an appropriate valuation model. Further details are given in note 43. That cost is recognised, together with a corresponding increase in share-based payment reserve in equity, over the period in which the performance and/or service conditions are fulfilled in employee benefits expense. The cumulative expense recognised for equity-settled transactions at each reporting date until the vesting date reflects the extent to which the vesting period has expired and the Company’s best estimate of the number of equity instruments that will ultimately vest. The expense or credit in the Statement of Profit and Loss for a period represents the movement in cumulative expense recognised as at the beginning and end of that period and is recognised in employee benefits expense. Service and non-market performance conditions are not taken into account when determining the grant date fair value of ESOPs, but the likelihood of the conditions being met is assessed as part of the Company’s best estimate of the number of equity instruments that will ultimately vest. Market performance conditions are reflected within the grant date fair value. Any other conditions attached to an ESOP, but without an associated service requirement, are considered to be non-vesting conditions. Non- vesting conditions are reflected in the fair value of an ESOP and lead to an immediate expensing of an ESOP unless there are also service and/or performance conditions. No expense is recognised for ESOPs that do not ultimately vest because non-market performance and/or service conditions have not been met. Where ESOPs include a market or non-vesting condition, the transactions are treated as vested irrespective of whether the market or non-vesting condition is satisfied, provided that all other performance and/or service conditions are satisfied. The dilutive effect of outstanding options is reflected as additional share dilution in the computation of diluted earnings per share. 23 Treasury shares The Company has created an ESOP Trust ( the ‘Trust’) for providing share-based payment to its employees. The Company uses the Trust as a vehicle for distributing shares to employees under the Employee Stock Option Scheme. The Trust purchases shares of the Company from the market or is issued shares by the Company, for giving shares to employees. The Company treats Trust as its extension and shares held by the Trust are treated as treasury shares. Own equity instruments that are re-acquired ( treasury shares ) are recognised at cost and deducted from other equity. No gain or loss is recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss on the purchase, sale, issue or cancellation of the Company’s own equity instruments. Share options exercised during the reporting period are settled with treasury shares. 24 Changes in accounting policies and disclosures New and amended standards Several amendments and interpretations apply for the first time in March 2024, but do not have an impact on the standalone financial statements of the Company. The Company has not early adopted any standards or amendments that have been issued but are not yet effective. The Ministry of Corporate Affairs has notified Companies ( Indian Accounting Standards ) Amendment Rules, 2023 dated 31 March 2023 to amend the following Ind AS which are effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 April 2023. The Company applied for the first-time this amendment: Disclosure of Accounting Policies - Amendments to Ind AS 1. The amendments aim to help entities provide accounting policy disclosures that are more useful by replacing the requirement for entities to disclose their ‘significant’ accounting policies with a requirement to disclose their ‘material’ accounting policies and adding guidance on how entities apply the concept of materiality in making decisions about accounting policy disclosures. The amendments have had an impact on the Company’s disclosures of accounting policies, but not on the measurement, recognition or presentation of any items in the Company’s financial statements.

Since investment properties leased out by the Company are cancellable and non-cancellable leases, the market rate for sale/purchase of such premises are representative of fair values. Company’s investment properties are at a location where active market is available for similar kind of properties. Hence, fair value is ascertained on the basis of market rates prevailing for similar properties in those locations determined by an independent registered valuer, as defined under rule 2 of Companies ( Registered Valuers and Valuation ) Rules 2017, and consequently classified as a level 2 valuation.

This includes traded bonds and mutual funds, as the case may be, that have quoted price/rate/value. Level 2: The fair value of financial instruments that are not traded in an active market are determined using valuation techniques which maximise the use of observable market data ( either directly as prices or indirectly derived from prices ) and rely as little as possible on entity-specific estimates. If all significant inputs required to fair value an instrument are observable, the instrument is included in level 2. Level 3: If one or more of the significant inputs is not based on observable market data, the instrument is included in level 3. This is the case for unlisted equity securities, contingent consideration and indemnification asset included in level 3.

STANDALONE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTES 186 Bajaj Auto Limited 17 th Annual Report 2023 - 24 Notes to standalone financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2024 ( Contd.) 33 Financial risk management The Company’s activities expose it to credit risk, liquidity risk and market risk ( including foreign exchange risk ). In order to minimise any adverse effects on the financial performance of the Company, derivative financial instruments such as foreign exchange forward contracts and foreign currency option contracts are entered to hedge certain foreign currency risk exposures. Derivatives are used exclusively for hedging purposes and not as trading or speculative instruments. This note explains the sources of risk which the Company is exposed to and how the entity manages the risk and the impact of hedge accounting in the financial statements.

The Company’s risk management is carried out by a treasury department as per such policies approved by the Board of Directors. Accordingly, Company’s treasury department identifies, evaluates and hedges financial risks. A ) Credit risk Credit risk refers to the risk that a counterparty may default on its contractual obligations leading to a financial loss to the Company. Credit risk primarily arises from cash and cash equivalents, derivative financial instruments, financial assets measured at amortised cost, financial assets measured at fair value through profit or loss and trade receivables. None of the financial instruments of the Company result in material concentration of credit risk. Credit risk management For Derivative instruments exposures are extended with multiple banks holding high credit risk ratings. In regard to Trade receivables, which are typically unsecured, credit risk is managed through credit approvals, establishing credit limits and continuously monitoring the creditworthiness of customers to whom credit is extended in the normal course of business. The Company follows a ‘simplified approach’ for recognition of impairment loss allowance on trade receivables. Accordingly, impairment loss allowance is recognised based on lifetime expected credit losses at each reporting date, right from its initial recognition. The provision rates are based on days past due; and the calculation reflects the probability weighted outcome, the time value of money and reasonable and supportable information that is available at the reporting date about past events, current conditions and forecasts of future economic conditions. 187 Bajaj Auto Limited 17 th Annual Report 2023 - 24 Notes to standalone financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2024 ( Contd.) 33 Financial risk management ( Contd.) Set out below is the information about the credit risk exposure of the Company’s trade receivables using provision matrix: ( H In Crore ) Particulars As on 31 March 20242023 Estimated total gross carrying amount 2,141.771,819.32 ECL 19.3743.20 Net carrying amount 2,122.401,776.12 Reconciliation of impairment allowance – Trade receivable Particulars ( J In Crore ) Impairment allowance as on 31 March 202239.66 Changes in loss allowance 3.54 Impairment allowance as on 31 March 202343.20 Changes in loss allowance ( 23.83 ) Impairment allowance as on 31 March 202419.37 For other financial assets, the Company has an investment policy which allows the Company to invest only with counterparties having a credit rating equal to or above AA+ and A 1+. The Company reviews the creditworthiness of these counterparties on an on- going basis. Counter-party limits maybe updated as and when required, subject to approval of the Board of Directors. B ) Liquidity risk The Company’s principal sources of liquidity are ‘cash and cash equivalents’ and cash flows that are generated from operations. The Company believes that its working capital is sufficient to meet the financial liabilities within maturity period. Apart from working capital facilities from banks which are repayable on demand, the Company has no outstanding long-term borrowings except sales tax deferral liability amounting to H 125.84 crore which are interest free and are repayable after 9 years from the Balance Sheet date. Additionally, the Company has invested its surplus funds in fixed income securities or instruments of similar profile thereby ensuring safety of capital and availability of liquidity as and when required. Hence the Company carries a negligible liquidity risk.

Foreign exchange risk arises from highly probable forecast transactions and recognised assets and liabilities denominated in a currency that is not the Company’s functional currency ( INR ). The risk is measured through sensitivity analysis. The primary objective for forex hedging against anticipated foreign currency risks will be to hedge the Company’s highly probable foreign currency cash flows arising from such transactions ( thus reducing volatility of cash flow and profit ). Due to the current stable foreign currency environment and the Company’s outlook on exchange rate movement, the Company decided not to hedge exports in current year. However, the Company continuously monitors this situation and may hedge export exposure based on market developments. The Company’s risk management policy permits the use of plain foreign exchange forward contracts and foreign currency option contracts including Foreign Currency - INR Option Cost Reduction Structures to hedge forecasted sales. The Company also imports certain materials the value of which is not material as compared to value of exports. Currently, The Company does not hedge this exposure. Nevertheless, the Company may wish to hedge such exposures. The Company uses a combination of foreign currency option contracts and foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge its exposure in foreign currency risk. The Company designates forward contracts in entirety and intrinsic value of foreign currency option contracts as the hedging instrument. To the extent these hedges are effective; the change in fair value of the hedging instrument is recognised through other comprehensive income in the ‘Cash flow hedging reserve’ within equity. The change in time value that relate to the hedged item ( aligned time value ) is recognised through other comprehensive income in ‘Costs of hedging reserve’ within equity. Amount recognised in equity is reclassified to profit or loss when the hedged item ( i.e. forecasted export sales ) affects Statement of Profit and Loss. The ineffective portion of change in fair value of the hedging instrument and any residual time value ( the non-aligned portion ), if any, is recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss immediately. The intrinsic value of foreign exchange option contracts is determined with reference to the relevant spot market exchange rate. The differential between the contracted strike rate and the spot market exchange rate is defined as the intrinsic value. Time value of the option is the difference between fair value of the option and the intrinsic value. 189 Bajaj Auto Limited 17 th Annual Report 2023 - 24 Notes to standalone financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2024 ( Contd.) 33 Financial risk management ( Contd.)

During the years ended 31 March 2024 and 31 March 2023, the Company did not have any hedging instruments with terms which were not aligned with those of the hedged items. Therefore, no ineffectiveness is recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss during the years ended 31 March 2024 and 31 March 2023.

The Company has invested its surplus funds primarily in debt based mutual funds and fixed maturity plans. The value of investment in these mutual fund schemes is reflected through Net Asset Value ( NAV ) declared by the Asset Management Company on daily basis. The Company has not performed a sensitivity analysis on these mutual funds based on estimated fluctuations in their NAV as in Management’s opinion, such analysis would not display a correct picture.

Sensitivity Analysis Gratuity is a lump sum plan and the cost of providing these benefits is typically less sensitive to small changes in demographic assumptions. The key actuarial assumptions to which the benefit obligation results are particularly sensitive to are discount rate and future salary escalation rate. The following table summarizes the impact in percentage terms on the reported defined benefit obligation ( DBO ) at the end of the reporting period arising on account of an increase or decrease in the reported assumption by 50 basis points. Particulars As at 31 March 2024 As at 31 March 2023 Discount rate Salary escalation rate Discount rate Salary escalation rate Senior staff Impact of increase in 50 bps on DBO ( 3.00 %) 3.09 %( 3.09 %) 3.18 % Impact of decrease in 50 bps on DBO 3.19 %( 2.94 %) 3.28 %( 3.03 %) Junior staff Impact of increase in 50 bps on DBO ( 3.65 %) 3.86 %( 3.21 %) 3.40 % Impact of decrease in 50 bps on DBO 3.99 %( 3.58 %) 3.50 %( 3.16 %) These sensitivities have been calculated to show the movement in defined benefit obligation in isolation and assuming there are no other changes in market conditions at the accounting date. There have been no changes from the previous periods in the methods and assumptions used in preparing the sensitivity analyses. Funding arrangement and policy The money contributed by the Company to the fund to finance the liabilities of the plan has to be invested. The trustees of the plan have outsourced the investment management of the fund to insurance companies. The insurance companies in turn manage these funds as per the mandate provided to them by the trustees and the asset allocation which is within the permissible limits prescribed in the insurance regulations. There is no compulsion on the part of the Company to fully pre fund the liability of the Plan. The Company’s philosophy is to fund the benefits based on its own liquidity and tax position as well as level of under funding of the plan. The expected contribution payable to the plan next year is H 15 crore. 38 Employee benefits ( Contd.) Funded schemes ( Contd.) Gratuity ( Contd.)

STANDALONE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTES 206 Bajaj Auto Limited 17 th Annual Report 2023 - 24 l. Bajaj Auto ( BAL ) uses SAP-S 4 HANA as the accounting software. SAP ensures an audit trail, providing standard functionality and logging in all changed data in the system. This functionality and audit trail feature in SAP has been operational throughout the year for all relevant transactions recorded through the application at BAL. At BAL, accounting documents are used to record all business transactions – posted documents are stored in SAP for every transaction and a financial document once posted cannot be deleted or changed for data points impacting financials. The SAP environment at BAL is appropriately governed and only authorised users can make postings in SAP, while interacting with the system through the application layer. Normal/regular users are not granted nor have direct SAP-DB ( database ) or super user level access which would allow them to make any changes to financial documents directly which have already been posted through the application. To operate the SAP-application and the SAP-DB, the system necessarily requires a set of super-users to have DB-level accesses. These super-users are obligated to perform system related tasks. They are not allowed to carry out any direct changes/edits to financial transactions in the SAP-DB, which if carried out is ill-legal. In the event of an unauthorised change by a super user specifically, these can be detected through an investigative approach and/or using services provided by SAP as part of their financial data quality check service, which validates the consistency of financials based on the request of the client. Therefore, while the SAP-DB at the moment does not have the concurrent real time audit trail feature in view of its infeasibility, the tracking of changes can be done through a focused enquiry process. m. The Company does not have any charges or satisfaction which is yet to be registered with ROC beyond the statutory period. n. Figures for previous year/period have been regrouped wherever necessary. 45 Miscellaneous Notes to standalone financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2024 ( Contd.)

Basis for opinion We conducted our audit of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with the Standards on Auditing ( SAs ), as specified under section 143 ( 10 ) of the Act. Our responsibilities under those Standards are further described in the ‘Auditors’ responsibilities for the audit of the consolidated financial statements’ section of our report. We are independent of the Group and its associate in accordance with the ‘Code of Ethics’ issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India together with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial statements under the provisions of the Act and the Rules thereunder, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements and the Code of Ethics. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion on the consolidated financial statements. Key audit matters We have determined that there are no key audit matters to communicate in our report. Other information The Holding Company’s Board of Directors is responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the information included in the Chairman’s letter, Management Discussion and Analysis, Business Responsibility and Sustainability Report, Corporate Governance and Directors’ Report, but does not include the consolidated financial statements and our auditors’ report thereon. Our opinion on the consolidated financial statements does not cover the other information and we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon. In connection with our audit of the consolidated financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether such other information is materially inconsistent with the consolidated financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard. Responsibilities of Management for the consolidated financial statements The Holding Company’s Board of Directors is responsible for the preparation and presentation of these consolidated financial statements in terms of the requirements of the Act that give a true and fair view of the consolidated financial position, consolidated financial performance including other comprehensive income, consolidated cash flows and consolidated statement of changes in equity of the Group including its associate in accordance with the accounting principles generally accepted in India, including the Indian Accounting Standards ( Ind AS ) specified under section 133 of the Act read with the Companies ( Indian Accounting Standards ) Rules, 2015, as amended. The respective Board of Directors of the companies included in the Group and of its associate are responsible for maintenance of adequate accounting records in accordance with the provisions of the Act for safeguarding the assets of their respective companies and for preventing and detecting frauds and other irregularities; selection and application of appropriate accounting policies; making judgments and estimates that are reasonable and prudent; and the design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls, that were operating effectively for ensuring the accuracy and completeness CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AUDIT REPORT 210 Bajaj Auto Limited 17 th Annual Report 2023 - 24 Independent Auditors‘ Report on the Consolidated Financial Statements ( Contd.) of the accounting records, relevant to the preparation and presentation of the consolidated financial statements that give a true and fair view and are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, which have been used for the purpose of preparation of the consolidated financial statements by the Directors of the Holding Company, as aforesaid. In preparing the consolidated financial statements, the respective Board of Directors of the companies included in the Group and of its associate are responsible for assessing the ability of their respective companies to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless management either intends to liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so. Those respective Board of Directors of the companies included in the Group and of its associate are also responsible for overseeing the financial reporting process of their respective companies. Auditors’ responsibilities for the audit of the consolidated financial statements Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditors’ report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with SAs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements. As part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also: l Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control. l Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances. Under section 143 ( 3 )( i ) of the Act, we are also responsible for expressing our opinion on whether the Holding Company has adequate internal financial controls with reference to financial statements in place and the operating effectiveness of such controls. l Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by Management. l Conclude on the appropriateness of Management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the ability of the Group and its associate to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditors’ report to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditors’ report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group and its associate to cease to continue as a going concern. l Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the consolidated financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation. l Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group and its associate of which we are the independent auditors and whose financial information we have audited, to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the audit of the financial statements of such entities included in the consolidated financial statements of which we are the independent auditors. For the other entities included in the consolidated financial statements, which have been audited by other auditors, such other auditors remain responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the audits carried out by them. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion. We communicate with those charged with governance of the Holding Company and such other entities included in the consolidated financial statements of which we are the independent auditors regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit. 211 Bajaj Auto Limited 17 th Annual Report 2023 - 24 Independent Auditors‘ Report on the Consolidated Financial Statements ( Contd.) We also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards. From the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the consolidated financial statements for the financial year ended 31 March 2024 and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditors’ report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication. Other matter ( a ) We did not audit the financial statements and other financial information, in respect of five ( 5 ) subsidiaries, whose financial statements include total assets of H 1,359.73 crore as at 31 March 2024, and total revenues of H 167.61 crore and net cash outflows of H 83.82 for the year ended on that date.

The financial statements have been prepared on a historical cost basis, except for certain financial assets and financial liabilities ( including derivative instruments ) that are measured at fair value. The financial statements are presented in INR, which is also the Company’s functional currency and all values are rounded to the nearest crore ( INR 0,000,000 ), except when otherwise indicated. All assets and liabilities, other than deferred tax assets and liabilities, have been classified as current or non-current as per the Company’s normal operating cycle and other criteria set out in the Schedule III ( Division II ) to the Act. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are classified as non-current assets and liabilities. Based on the nature of products and the time between the acquisition of assets for processing and their realisation in cash and cash equivalents, the Group has ascertained its operating cycle as 12 months for current and non-current classification of assets and liabilities. Material accounting policies This note provides a list of the material accounting policies adopted in the preparation of these financial statements. These policies have been consistently applied to all the years presented, unless otherwise stated. 1 Basis of Consolidation The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company and all its subsidiaries, being the entities that it controls. Control is evidenced where the Group has power over the investee or is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the Notes to consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2024 CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTES 226 Bajaj Auto Limited 17 th Annual Report 2023 - 24 investee. Power is demonstrated through existing rights that give the ability to direct relevant activities, which significantly affect the entity returns. The financial statements of subsidiaries are prepared for the same reporting year as the parent company. Where necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to align the accounting policies in line with accounting policies of the Group. For non-wholly owned subsidiaries, a share of the profit/loss for the financial year and net assets is attributed to the non-controlling interests as shown in the consolidated statement of profit and loss and consolidated balance sheet. For acquisitions of additional interests in subsidiaries, where there is no change in control, the Group recognises a reduction to the non-controlling interest of the respective subsidiary with the difference between this figure and the cash paid, inclusive of transaction fees, being recognised in equity. In addition, upon dilution of controlling interests the difference between the cash received from sale or listing of the subsidiary shares and the increase to non-controlling interest is also recognised in equity. The financial statements of subsidiaries acquired or disposed off during the year are included in the consolidated statement of profit and loss from the effective date of acquisition or up to the effective date of disposal, as appropriate. Intragroup balances and transactions, and any unrealised income and expenses arising from intragroup transactions, are eliminated in preparing the consolidated financial statements. Unrealised losses are eliminated unless costs cannot be recovered. The financial statements of Bajaj Auto ( Thailand ) Ltd., Bajaj Auto Spain S.L.U. and Bajaj Do Brasil Comercio De Motocicletas Ltda are prepared with a three months’ time lag for consolidation into the Group financial statements. 2 Investment in associates Investments in associates are accounted for using the equity method. An associate is an entity over which the Group is in a position to exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies. The considerations made in determining whether significant influence is being exercised are similar to those necessary to determine control over the subsidiaries. Goodwill arising on the acquisition of associates is included in the carrying value of investments in associates. The Group’s investments in its associate are accounted for using the equity method. Under the equity method, the investment in an associate is initially recognised at cost. The carrying amount of the investment is adjusted to recognise changes in the Group’s share of net assets of the associate since the acquisition date. Goodwill relating to the associate is included in the carrying amount of the investment and is not tested for impairment individually. The Statement of Profit and Loss reflects the Group’s share of the results of operations of the associate. Any change in OCI of those investees is presented as part of the Group’s OCI. In addition, when there has been a change recognised directly in the equity of the associate, the Group recognises its share of any changes, when applicable, in the Statement of Changes in Equity. Unrealised gains and losses resulting from transactions between the Group and the associate are eliminated to the extent of the interest in the associate. If an entity’s share of losses of an associate equals or exceeds its interest in the associate ( which includes any long-term interest that, in substance, form part of the Group’s net investment in the associate ), the entity discontinues recognising its share of further losses. Additional losses are recognised only to the extent that the Group has incurred legal or constructive obligations or made payments on behalf of the associate. If the associate subsequently reports profits, the entity resumes recognising its share of those profits only after its share of the profits equals the share of losses not recognised. The aggregate of the Group’s share of profit or loss of an associate is shown on the face of the Statement of Profit and Loss. The financial statements of the associate are prepared with a three months’ time lag for consolidation into the Group financial statements. When necessary, adjustments are made to bring the accounting policies in line with those of the Group. The Group has not identified any material adjustments during the year; in regard to the alignment of accounting policies. After application of the equity method, the Group determines whether it is necessary to recognise an impairment loss on its investment in its associate. At each reporting date, the Group determines whether there is objective evidence that the investment in the associate is impaired. If there is such evidence, the Group calculates the amount of impairment as the difference between the recoverable amount of the associate and its carrying value, and then recognises the loss in the Statement of Profit and Loss. Upon loss of significant influence over the associate, the Group measures and recognises any retained investment at its fair value. Any difference between the carrying amount of the associate upon loss of significant influence and the fair value of the retained investment and proceeds from disposal is recognised in Statement of Profit and Loss. Notes to consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2024 ( Contd.) 1 Summary of material accounting policies followed by the Group ( Contd.) 227 Bajaj Auto Limited 17 th Annual Report 2023 - 24 3 Foreign currencies The Group’s consolidated financial statements are presented in INR, which is also the parent company’s functional currency. For each entity the Group determines the functional currency and items included in the financial statements of each entity are measured using that functional currency. The Group uses the direct method of consolidation and on disposal of a foreign operation the gain or loss that is reclassified to profit or loss reflects the amount that arises from using this method. Transactions and balances Transactions in foreign currencies are initially recorded by the Group’s entities at their respective functional currency spot rates at the date the transaction first qualifies for recognition. However, for practical reasons, the group uses an average rate if the average approximates the actual rate at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the functional currency spot rates of exchange at the reporting date. Exchange differences arising on settlement or translation of monetary items are recognised in Statement of Profit and Loss with the exception of the following: Exchange differences arising on monetary items that forms part of a reporting entity’s net investment in a foreign operation are recognised in Statement of Profit and Loss in the separate financial statements of the reporting entity or the individual financial statements of the foreign operation, as appropriate. In the financial statements that include the foreign operation and the reporting entity ( e.g., consolidated financial statements when the foreign operation is a subsidiary ), such exchange differences are recognised initially in Statement of Other Comprehensive Income (‘OCI’). These exchange differences are reclassified from equity to profit or loss on disposal of the net investment. Tax charges and credits attributable to exchange differences on those monetary items are also recorded in OCI. Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rates at the dates of the initial transactions. Non-monetary items measured at fair value in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rates at the date when the fair value is determined. The gain or loss arising on translation of non-monetary items measured at fair value is treated in line with the recognition of the gain or loss on the change in fair value of the item ( i.e., translation differences on items whose fair value gain or loss is recognised in OCI or profit or loss are also recognised in OCI or Statement of Profit and Loss, respectively ). Group companies On consolidation, the assets and liabilities of foreign operations are translated into INR at the rate of exchange prevailing at the reporting date and their Statement of Profit and Loss are translated at exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transactions. For practical reasons, the group uses an average rate to translate income and expense items, if the average rate approximates the exchange rates at the dates of the transactions. The exchange differences arising on translation for consolidation are recognised in OCI. On disposal of a foreign operation, the component of OCI relating to that particular foreign operation is recognised in Statement of Profit and Loss. Any goodwill arising in the acquisition/business combination of a foreign operation and any fair value adjustments to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities arising on the acquisition are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign operation and translated at the spot rate of exchange at the reporting date. Gain or loss on a subsequent disposal of any foreign operation excludes translation differences that arose before the date of transition but includes only translation differences arising after the transition date. 4 Taxation a ) Current income tax assets and liabilities are measured at the amount expected to be recovered from or paid to the taxation authorities. The tax rates and tax laws used to compute the amount are those that are enacted or substantively enacted, at the reporting date in the countries where the Group operates and generates taxable income.

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTES 228 Bajaj Auto Limited 17 th Annual Report 2023 - 24 b ) Current income tax relating to items recognised outside Statement of Profit and Loss is recognised outside Statement of Profit and Loss ( either in other comprehensive income or in equity ). Current tax items are recognised in correlation to the underlying transaction either in OCI or directly in equity. Management periodically evaluates positions taken in the tax returns with respect to situations in which applicable tax regulations are subject to interpretation and establishes provisions where appropriate. c ) Deferred tax is provided using the liability method on temporary differences arising between the tax base of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the financial statements. Deferred tax is determined using tax rates that have been enacted or substantially enacted by the end of the reporting period and are expected to apply when the related deferred tax asset is realised or the deferred tax liability is settled. Deferred tax assets are recognised for all deductible temporary differences and unused tax losses only if it is probable that future taxable amounts will be available to utilise those temporary differences. d ) Deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are offset if a legally enforceable right exists to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities and the deferred taxes relate to the same taxable entity and the same taxation authority. 5 Other material accounting policies Other material accounting policies followed by the Group are exactly similar to the material accounting policies of the parent, Bajaj Auto Ltd.; and hence have not been reproduced here.

Quotes would include rates/values/valuation references published periodically by BSE, NSE etc. basis which trades take place in a linked or unlinked active market. This includes traded bonds and mutual funds, as the case may be, that have quoted price/rate/value. Level 2: The fair value of financial instruments that are not traded in an active market are determined using valuation techniques which maximise the use of observable market data ( either directly as prices or indirectly derived from prices ) and rely as little as possible on entity-specific estimates. If all significant inputs required to fair value an instrument are observable, the instrument is included in level 2. Level 3: If one or more of the significant inputs is not based on observable market data, the instrument is included in level 3. This is the case for unlisted equity securities, contingent consideration and indemnification asset included in level 3.

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTES 252 Bajaj Auto Limited 17 th Annual Report 2023 - 24 Notes to consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2024 ( Contd.) The Group’s activities expose it to credit risk, liquidity risk and market risk ( including foreign exchange risk ). In order to minimise any adverse effects on the financial performance of the Group, derivative financial instruments such as foreign exchange forward contracts and foreign currency option contracts are entered to hedge certain foreign currency risk exposures. Derivatives are used exclusively for hedging purposes and not as trading or speculative instruments. This note explains the sources of risk which the Group is exposed to and how the entity manages the risk and the impact of hedge accounting in the financial statements.

Trade receivablesCredit Limit and Ageing analysis No. of overdue days, monitoring of credit limits Liquidity RiskOther liabilitiesMaturity analysisMaintaining sufficient cash/cash equivalents and marketable securities Market Risk- Foreign Exchange Highly probable forecast transactions and financial assets and liabilities not denominated in INR Sensitivity analysisForward foreign exchange contracts and foreign currency options. - The Group has not hedged its FCY borrowings as it is naturally hedged against receivables. - Interest Rate Risk The Board of Directors provide guiding principles for overall risk management, as well as policies covering specific areas, such as foreign exchange risk, credit risk, use of derivative financial instruments and non-derivative financial instruments, and investment of available funds. The Group’s risk management is carried out by a treasury department as per such policies approved by the Board of Directors. Accordingly, Group’s treasury department identifies, evaluates and hedges financial risks. A ) Credit risk Credit risk refers to the risk that a counterparty may default on its contractual obligations leading to a financial loss to the Group. Credit risk primarily arises from cash and cash equivalents, derivative financial instruments, financial assets measured at amortised cost, financial assets measured at fair value through profit or loss and trade receivables. None of the financial instruments of the Group result in material concentration of credit risk. Credit risk management For Derivative instruments exposures are extended with multiple banks holding high credit risk ratings. In regard to Trade receivables, which are typically unsecured, credit risk is managed through credit approvals, establishing credit limits and continuously monitoring the credit worthiness of customers to whom credit is extended in the normal course of business. The Group follows a ‘simplified approach’ for recognition of impairment loss allowance on trade receivables. Accordingly, impairment loss allowance is recognised based on lifetime expected credit losses at each reporting date, right from its initial recognition. The provision rates are based on days past due; and the calculation reflects the probability weighted outcome, the time value of money and reasonable and supportable information that is available at the reporting date about past events, current conditions and forecasts of future economic conditions. 35 Financial risk management 253 Bajaj Auto Limited 17 th Annual Report 2023 - 24 Set out below is the information about the credit risk exposure of the Group’s trade receivables using provision matrix: ( H In Crore ) Particulars As on 31 March 20242023 Estimated total gross carrying amount 2,094.901,795.63 ECL 19.3743.20 Net carrying amount 2,075.531,752.43 Classification of financial assets under various stages Stage 1: unimpaired and without significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition on which a 12-month allowance for ECL is recognised; Stage 2: a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition on which a 12-month ECL is recognised Particulars As on 31 March 20242023 Term Loans to customers under Financing 710.84– ECL 3.10– Net carrying value 7 0 7.74– Stage classification for advances is based on lifetime ECL model Particulars As on 31 March 20242023 Advances to dealer 242.55– ECL 0.98– Net carrying value 241.57– Reconciliation of impairment allowance – Trade receivable Particulars ( J In Crore ) Impairment allowance as on 31 March 202239.66 Changes in loss allowance 3.54 Impairment allowance as on 31 March 202343.20 Changes in loss allowance ( 23.83 ) Impairment allowance as on 31 March 202419.37 For other financial assets, the Group has an investment policy which allows the Group to invest only with counterparties having a credit rating equal to or above AA+ and A 1+. The Group reviews the creditworthiness of these counterparties on an on-going basis. Counter party limits maybe updated as and when required, subject to approval of Board of Directors. 35 Financial risk management ( Contd.)

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTES 254 Bajaj Auto Limited 17 th Annual Report 2023 - 24 B ) Liquidity risk The Group’s principal source of liquidity are ‘cash and cash equivalents’ and cash flows that are generated from operations. The Group believes that its working capital is sufficient to meet the financial liabilities within maturity period. Apart from long-term borrowings of H 633.33 crore, the Group has sales tax deferral liability amounting to H 125.84 crore which is interest free and is repayable after 9 years from the Balance Sheet date.Additionally, the Group has invested its surplus funds in fixed income securities or instruments of similar profile thereby ensuring safety of capital and availability of liquidity as and when required. Hence the Group carries a negligible liquidity risk. ( H In Crore ) Particulars As at 31 March 20242023 The Company had Net working capital funds 2 ,7 0 7.144,379.65 which includes; i ) Cash and cash equivalents 560.45241. 62 ii ) Current investments 5,431.594,581.35 The table below summarises the contractual maturities of financial liabilities as at 31 March 2024 and 31 March 2023: Maturities of financial liabilities ( H In Crore ) Particulars Less than and equal to 1 year More than 1 yearTotal As on 31 March 2024 Non-derivatives Sales tax deferral ( discounted ) 125. 8 4125. 8 4 Trade payables 5 , 59 7. 3 95 , 59 7. 3 9 Long-term borrowings 633.33633.33 Short-term borrowings 1,152.571,152.57 Other financial liabilities 597.03 – 597.03 7,346.99759.178 ,106.16 As on 31 March 2023 Non-derivatives Sales tax deferral ( discounted )–124 . 23124 . 23 Trade payables 4 ,121.18 – 4 ,121.18 Other financial liabilities 464.09 – 464.09 4,585.27124 . 234,709.50 35 Financial risk management ( Contd.) Notes to consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2024 ( Contd.) 255 Bajaj Auto Limited 17 th Annual Report 2023 - 24 C ) Market risk ( i ) Foreign currency risk The Group has significant exports and is therefore exposed to foreign exchange risk arising from foreign currency transactions, primarily with respect to the US $. Foreign exchange risk arises from highly probable forecast transactions and recognised assets and liabilities denominated in a currency that is not the Group’s functional currency ( INR ). The risk is measured through sensitivity analysis. The primary objective for forex hedging against anticipated foreign currency risks will be to hedge the Group’s highly probable foreign currency cash flows arising from such transactions ( thus reducing volatility of cash flow and profit ). The Group’s risk management policy permits the use of plain foreign exchange forward contracts and foreign currency option contracts including Foreign Currency - INR Option Cost Reduction Structures to hedge forecasted sales. The Group also imports certain materials the value of which is not material as compared to value of exports. Currently, Group does not hedge this exposure. Nevertheless, Group may wish to hedge such exposures. The Group uses a combination of foreign currency option contracts and foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge its exposure in foreign currency risk. The Group designates forward contracts in entirety and intrinsic value of foreign currency option contracts as the hedging instrument. To the extent these hedges are effective; the change in fair value of the hedging instrument is recognised through other comprehensive income in the ‘Cash flow hedging reserve’ within equity. The change in time value that relate to the hedged item ( aligned time value ) is recognised through other comprehensive income in ‘Costs of hedging reserve’ within equity. Amount recognised in equity is reclassified to consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss when the hedged item ( i.e. forecasted export sales ) affects consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss. The ineffective portion of change in fair value of the hedging instrument and any residual time value ( the non-aligned portion ), if any, is recognised in the consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss immediately. The intrinsic value of foreign exchange option contracts is determined with reference to the relevant spot market exchange rate. The differential between the contracted strike rate and the spot market exchange rate is defined as the intrinsic value. Time value of the option is the difference between fair value of the option and the intrinsic value. Open exposure The Group’s exposure to foreign currency risk at the end of the reporting period are as follows ( USD Million ) As at 31 March 20242023 Receivables 9 7. 8 370.26 Payables 20.237.03 Borrowings 100.00- Others ( EEFC balances ) 24 . 413.98 Impact of hedging activities ( a ) Disclosure of effects of hedge accounting on financial position: Cash flow hedge foreign exchange risk 31 March 2024 ( H In Crore ) Particulars Nominal value Carrying amount of hedging instrument Hedge ratio* Changes in fair value of hedging instrument Change in the value of hedged item used as a basis for recognising hedge effectiveness Foreign currency options––N.A.–– –––– 35 Financial risk management ( Contd.)

During the years ended 31 March 2024 and 31 March 2023, the Group did not have any hedging instruments with terms which were not aligned with those of the hedged items. Therefore, no ineffectiveness is recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss during the years ended 31 March 2024 and 31 March 2023. 35 Financial risk management ( Contd.)

The Group has invested its surplus funds primarily in debt based mutual funds and fixed maturity plans. The value of investment in these mutual fund schemes is reflected though Net Asset Value ( NAV ) declared by the Asset Management Group on daily basis. The Group has not performed a sensitivity analysis on these mutual funds based on estimated fluctuations in their NAV as in management’s opinion, such analysis would not display a correct picture. 35 Financial risk management ( Contd.)

Funded schemes ( Contd.) Gratuity ( Contd.) Sensitivity Analysis Gratuity is a lump sum plan and the cost of providing these benefits is typically less sensitive to small changes in demographic assumptions. The key actuarial assumptions to which the benefit obligation results are particularly sensitive to are discount rate and future salary escalation rate. The following table summarises the impact in percentage terms on the reported defined benefit obligation ( DBO ) at the end of the reporting period arising on account of an increase or decrease in the reported assumption by 50 basis points. Particulars As at 31 March 2024 As at 31 March 2023 Discount rate Salary escalation rate Discount rate Salary escalation rate Senior staff Impact of increase in 50 bps on DBO ( 3.00 %) 3.09 %( 3.09 %) 3.18 % Impact of decrease in 50 bps on DBO 3.19 %( 2.94 %) 3.28 %( 3.03 %) Junior staff Impact of increase in 50 bps on DBO ( 3.65 %) 3.86 %( 3.21 %) 3.40 % Impact of decrease in 50 bps on DBO 3.99 %( 3.58 %) 3.50 %( 3.16 %) These sensitivities have been calculated to show the movement in defined benefit obligation in isolation and assuming there are no other changes in market conditions at the accounting date. There have been no changes from the previous periods in the methods and assumptions used in preparing the sensitivity analyses. Funding arrangement and policy The money contributed by the Group to the fund to finance the liabilities of the plan has to be invested. The trustees of the plan have outsourced the investment management of the fund to insurance companies. The insurance companies in turn manage these funds as per the mandate provided to them by the trustees and the asset allocation which is within the permissible limits prescribed in the insurance regulations. There is no compulsion on the part of the Group to fully pre fund the liability of the Plan. The Group’s philosophy is to fund the benefits based on its own liquidity and tax position as well as level of under funding of the plan. The expected contribution payable to the plan next year is H 15.85 crore. Notes to consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2024 ( Contd.)

The Group does not have any transaction which is not recorded in the books of accounts that has been surrendered or disclosed as income during the year in the tax assessments under the Income Tax Act, 1961 ( such as, search or survey or any other relevant provisions of the Income Tax Act, 1961 ). l. Bajaj Auto ( BAL ) uses SAP-S 4 HANA as the accounting software. SAP ensures an audit trail, providing standard functionality and logging in all changed data in the system. This functionality and audit trail feature in SAP has been operational throughout the year for all relevant transactions recorded through the application at BAL. At BAL, accounting documents are used to record all business transactions – posted documents are stored in SAP for every transaction and a financial document once posted cannot be deleted or changed for data points impacting financials. The SAP environment at BAL is appropriately governed and only authorised users can make postings in SAP, while interacting with the system through the application layer. Normal/regular users are not granted nor have direct SAP-DB ( database ) or super user level access which would allow them to make any changes to financial documents directly which have already been posted through the application. To operate the SAP-application and the SAP-DB, the system necessarily requires a set of super-users to have DB-level accesses. These super-users are obligated to perform system related tasks. They are not allowed to carry out any direct changes/edits to financial transactions in the SAP-DB, which if carried out is ill-legal. In the event of an unauthorised change by a super user specifically, these can be detected through an investigative approach and/or using services provided by SAP as part of their financial data quality check service, which validates the consistency of financials based on the request of the client. Therefore, while the SAP-DB at the moment does not have the concurrent real time audit trail feature in view of its infeasibility, the tracking of changes can be done through a focused enquiry process. m. The Group does not have any charges or satisfaction which is yet to be registered with ROC beyond the statutory period. n. Figures for previous year/period have been regrouped wherever necessary.

Overview of the entity’s material responsible business conduct issues Please indicate material responsible business conduct and sustainability issues pertaining to environmental and social mat- ters that present a risk or an opportunity to your business, rationale for identifying the same, and approach to adapt or miti- gate the risk along with its financial implications, as per the following format Material issue identified Indicate whether risk or opportunity ( R/O ) Rationale for identifying the risk/opportunity In case of risk, approach to adapt or mitigate Financial implications of the risk or opportunity ( indicate positive or negative implications ) Extended product approval process RiskIt is a long process to get approval from regulatory authorities for a new product. For this reason, end-users of additives generally prefer established organisation’s with all formalities/ certifications in place. This stands as a barrier for an additive manufacturer trying to enter new geographies and reach out to new customers, as country-specific approval is required and each country has different parameters for approval • Understanding the approval process in detail and having in place all certificates required, will expedite the process • Focus on improving communication with all relevant stakeholders, both locally and internationally Negative- Revenue loss for the organisation Vegetable oil prices RiskFluctuations in vegetable oil prices due to fluctuating demand and supply indirectly affect the financial performance of the organisation • Keeping sufficient stock of raw materials so that the organisation is not affected by sudden market fluctuations • Maintaining robust relationships with key suppliers Negative- Rising costs of raw materials can lead to diminished profit margins and adversely impact the organisation's financial performance Industry growth OpportunityEnd-users switching from synthetic and conventional materials to organic and natural additives, incorporating sustainable and environmentally friendly materials into their processes –Positive- Higher demand will lead to increased revenue Customer specification OpportunityBy paying attention to each customer's unique requirements and delivering tailored solutions, the Company establishes a bond of trust between the organisation and the customer –Positive- Increase revenue by providing customised solutions and building trust 100 Fine Organic Industries Limited Material issue identified Indicate whether risk or opportunity ( R/O ) Rationale for identifying the risk/opportunity In case of risk, approach to adapt or mitigate Financial implications of the risk or opportunity ( indicate positive or negative implications ) Impact of climate change RiskThe business may face challenges due to adverse weather conditions and climate change, as these factors can have an impact on crop production. Since vegetable oils, which are key raw materials for the industry, are derived from crops, any negative effects on them can affect their availability. Additionally, climate change and related natural disasters like floods, cyclones, and droughts can introduce volatility in raw material prices, potentially influencing farmers' decisions. Such disruptions can also impact supply chains, production facilities, and even customer demand and preferences • Sustainable sourcing from developed key suppliers can mitigate risks for the Company by ensuring a stable and reliable supply of raw materials while promoting environmental stewardship and resilience • Improvement in processes to generate less emissions • Sustainable logistics management Negative- Most suppliers opt for short-term contracts spanning 3 to 6 months, occasionally extending to 12 months when required, owing to global uncertainties Health & safety RiskIn the chemical industry, health & safety can cause a potential harm to individuals and communities, operational disruptions, regulatory non-compliance consequences, and reputation damage. Proactive risk management and adherence to safety protocols are essential to mitigate these risks effectively and ensure business sustainability • Prioritising safety protocols and regulatory compliance • Identifying and mitigating operational hazards • Ensuring swift incident response and containment • Providing comprehensive safety education and awareness • Integrating lessons learned for ongoing safety enhancement Negative- Health and safety incidents can lead to financial losses through regulatory fines, legal liabilities, production shutdowns, and damage to facilities, impacting the Company's profitability, reputation, and market competitiveness Regulatory issues and compliance RiskFailure to comply with regulatory issues not only causes risks of legal repercussions but also undermines the Company's reputation. Given the industry's sensitivity to safety and environmental concerns, any deviation could erode trust among stakeholders, affecting market presence and financial stability • Ensuring adherence to compliance monitoring system Negative- Non-compliance can lead to fines, legal expenses, and production delays for the Company, while tarnishing the brand image and reducing customer trust, impacting financial performance Reducing carbon footprint Opportunity Ensuring the reduction of carbon footprint helps to align with global sustainability objectives and mitigates the effects of global climate change while fostering innovation –Positive- Reducing the carbon footprint can yield positive financial outcomes and enhance brand reputation Statutory Reports 101 Annual Report 2023 - 24 1. a.
